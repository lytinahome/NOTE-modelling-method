# Decision Tree

#### What need to learn when developing a decision tree?
+ the shape of the tree (very hard --> Greedy Algorithm)
+ split threshold
+ value in each leaf 

#### how to choose the best decision tree?
+ has exponential number of candicates
+ greedy algorithm -- to optimize the uncertainty: using Entrogy or Mutual information.
+ select the features


#### when to stop splitting?
+ to avoid overfitting
+ set the maximum depth
+ set minimum leaf sample
+ rely on cross validation
